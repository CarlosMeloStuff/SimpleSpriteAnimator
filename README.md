# SimpleSpriteAnimator
Simpler 2D sprite animation in Unity

Simple sprite animation in Unity is too complicated. You have to create animations, set up animator states, add transitions, and much more. This project aims to make sprite animation much simpler.

## This is an early WIP, I would not recommend using it yet. Feel free to submit feature requests though.
